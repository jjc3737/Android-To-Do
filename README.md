Submittied by: Jane Chung 

Time spent: 13 hours spent in total 

## User Stories 
The following required functionality is completed:

* User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
* User can tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following optional features are implemented:

* Persist the todo items through SQLite 
* Improve style of the todo items in the list using Custom Adapter
* Add support for completion due dates for todo items and show on list 
* Use a DialogFragment (In earlier commit this is present, newest ui doesn't) 
* Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds (More to come) 

The following additional features are implemented: 

* Sort the list by priority 
* UI/UX change for when tasks are finished 
* Added splash screen
* Custom fonts

## Notes 
I plan to spend more time getting more of the optional features done. The only frustration was everything required looking up the definition and docs. Also, learning SQLite took some time since it was my first time using it.
